# Collection Of Quickstarts for useful apps

This is just a collection of apps that you generally might need to run locally.
Its easier to run them using docker so I have setup some docker-compose files
to work with

## Getting Started

make sure you have docker installed (you will need one docker compose V2)

```bash
# APP is the application you would like to run
make run=${APP}
```

### Currently supported

- [x] Postgres (with PGAdmin)
- [x] Jupyter Notebooks
- [x] MongoDB
